# April Tag Motion Capture

Python based tracker comparing april tags on a field to ones on a robot, with the goal of finding the robots exact
postion and heading on the field to compare against odometry pod data. 

Currently now being worked on because i can't figure out how to get April Tags working.
Open to advice and/or alternate tags/languages!

An off season project because im bored
